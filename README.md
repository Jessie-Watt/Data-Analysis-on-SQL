# Data-analysis-of-student-s-information-health-record-and-their-performance-using-SQL.

# **INTRODUCTION**
In today's world data is widely used by different organizations to take decisions to aid improvemnt in work efficiency, research and many others facets. Structured Query Language(SQL) is a standardized programming language used to manage relatinal database. SQL will be used in this task to create three tables containing student's information, their health records and their performance.

# **ACTIVITY**
1. The creation of database names 'Students Record'.
2. The use creation of three tables in the Students Record Database
     a) Students Information (Student ID, Gender, Name, Age, Subject)
     b) Health Records (Students ID, Blood Group, Health, Weight)
     c) Performance(Student ID, Score, Grade)
4. Making the 'Student ID' column for the three tables to be unique 
5. Where a student has no score, it should be ')' by default
6. Adding a constraint that prevents the Student ID and subject from taking null values.
7. The droping of columns using constraint
8. The changing of column name from 'subject' to course

# **SKILL DEMONSTRATED**
Creating a new database
The use of operational keys
Creating tables and inserting values in the rows
Applying Constraint

# SOLUTIONS
A new database named 'Students Record' was created on the SQL server management by cliking on 'New Query', this activated a work interface where I wrote the code 'CREATE DATABASE STUDENTS_RECORD;' then executed the code, this developed a database accessed on the left-handside of the work interface.

In the students records database, the students_info table was formulated with operational keywords as 'create', 'table'
